# Molecular Dynamics Potentials (MDP)

# Installation

No installation is required since MDP generates and compiles C++ source code on the fly. Note MDP uses CMAKE to compile source code.

# Applications

Run snapTA06A.jl script in the Applications/snap folder. The first run is slow since it takes a minute to compile MDP's core libraries and executable files. Subsequent runs will be faster.
